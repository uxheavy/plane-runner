## Completion evidence

Wave 0AM completed one exact, non-UI primary. The functional Plane lifecycle
and provider-disabled replay passed internally, but the final bounded evidence
contract failed standalone validation (`evidence_permitted_canary_failed`), so
S00 remains dirty and UT-018/UT-019 remain open. No source fix or Hermes change
was made.

## Final risks and decision

Decision: `FAIL`. The journey is not clean enough to close S00 or unlock W/M/O.
The remaining blocker is the success-receipt contract: it must retain the
ordered `s00Gate` projection and semantic digest, and its canary identifiers
must agree with the fresh authority and emitted evidence.
